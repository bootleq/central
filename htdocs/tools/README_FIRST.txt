This directory contains program/tools made by me (or others)
to help Mozilla localization.

mozip.c/mozip.exe is the 'mozip' to create W32 localized builds.
This version does not need Cygwin anymore.
I've posted its usage on the mailling list, so no document here.
And do not disturb me for that.

mt094.jar/mt099.jar are MozillaTranslator's. mt094 is MT 0.9.4,
while mt099 is my hacked version which supports recent Mozilla
since 0.9.9 (using by me now).

wintools.zip is the wintools.zip from Mozilla.
