   You don't have to "modify". You can create a new one, it's even simpler
   than the way we used to with mozip.

   http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/installer/windows/
   Get app.tag and 7zip.bat from the url above.
   Of course you should have 7zip installed.

   Now zip all your files into a 7zip file.
   Modify 7zip.bat to match the PATH of your own system environment.
   Then just run 7zip.bat and you'll have a working installer.

   However you need one more file described in the 7zip.bat, the SFX
   loader itself. You may use the SFXs provided by officla 7zip (*.sfx)
   but their icons were different. If you want to use the SFX by Mozilla
   Firefox, use some software, search for the app.tag file inside the
   big SFX exe, then split it up.

   Get the JP or FR or IT language pack ones they've posted
   (Thank you all who have been pioneers), extract the XPI and
   get the install.rdf and locale switcher program. Take JP langpack
   for example, it was lpswitcher.jar.

   Integrate the 2 files to your package and modify them.
   You must get a GUID, of course (Currently it seems like that
   a random number not generated as real GUID also works. But if
   you want a real GUID, google for 'guidgen', a program by microsoft).

   And after you package your file in same layout, the new XPI should work.

   Some hints in my experience:
   If your XPI does not work (mostly firefox pops up showing
   'installing' messages when startup and then frozen), check your
   install.rdf. Every chrome registeration and file MUST be exactly
   existing. (If you were using install.js, registering for a 
   non-exist chrome will not cause any error)

   That's not so the true. The major improvement comes from 7zip.
   7zip with LZMA is an amazing compression method that can make the archive
   smaller about 30~40% in comparision to traditional ZIP/gz which is
   used by original Mozilla (including Firefox).
   And during 0.8 to 0.9 some people checked the resource (locale,
   content, ... stuff) in Mozilla * to remove several comments and code
   not in use. That speeds up the startup time.

May the source be with you,
