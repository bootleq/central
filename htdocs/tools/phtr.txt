> 1. Exactly which files needs to be translated?
   First I think you must have some experience about translating
   Mozilla, or at least knowing how to translate Mozilla.
   Translating Phoenix is just like translating Mozilla.
   As you know, Phoenix is a special version of Mozilla.

   For information about translating Mozilla, Ref:
   http://www.mozilla.org/projects/l10n/mlp_howto.html
   http://www.asturies.com/viesca/software/mozilla/MANUAL.HTM

   Then you'll find out that only files in chrome/en-*.jar, chrome/US.jar
   and some optional jars containing 'locale' directories need to
   be translated.
  
> 2. What software is best to use (or is it best to just edit the text files?)
   Just like Mozilla, I'd prefer MozillaTranslator.
   You may download the latest version (5.x?), though I use a tweaked
   version from 4.36 by myself.

   With MozillaTranslator you can easily get the answer.
   MozillaTranslator has a feature to 'update' your glossary file.
   So every time getting a new release of Phoenix, I try to 'update' from
   both latest Mozilla glossary and previous version of Phoenix, then
   compare and decide which to use.

> 4. When you have translated the files, how do you actually distribute

   I have compilers, but I don't like building the lizzard (or the phoenix) either.
   After getting the knowledge about translating Mozilla, you'll know
   that no binaries should be re-compiled. Just pack the locale files
   (maybe in jar, like zh-TW.jar, zh-win.jar...) into Phoenix's zip file.
   (Maybe you've heard of mozip for Win32, but that's not needed in Phoenix
    because we don't have an official sea installer now)

   Some tips:
   Phoenix does not have any interface to change locale, so you must do
   this on your own. My steps:
     (1) Translate and build your own locale archive like zh-TW.jar, TW.jar, ...
     (2) Remove en-*.jar, US.jar. Put your archives in chrome/.
     (3) Edit chrome/installed-chrome.txt and change all en-US to your
         locale. I do this inside VI(M) with these commands:
         :%s/en-US/zh-TW/g
         :%s/en-/zh-/g
         :%s/US/TW/g
     (4) delete the chrome/chrome.rdf and subdirectories 'overlayinfo'.
         In fact you can remove all subdirectories in chrome/.
         Don't worry. They'll be created automatically when Phoenix starts.
     (5) Pack your changes to zip, or (in my case) make a SFX
         (self-extractable) version to help user install Phoenix.
         On Win32, I'd like WinRAR.
     (6) Remember to remove all your previous profiles before you try
         the localized version.
