              <img alt="Scott Goodson" src="../images/goodson.jpg" class="bio" />
              <p>Scott is a true frog. Born into an advertising family, he worked his way up in the biz. Originally from Canada, he has worked on the world's most iconic brands in the US and globally.
              <p>He is a writer, traveller, philosopher, amateur chef, and entrepreneur.
              <p>He spent 10 years in Sweden as co-owner of a Stockholm ad agency, named Media International's European agency of the year, with clients like Virgin Airlines, Daimler Chrysler and Ericsson.
              <p>He was Executive Creative Director of JWT where he learned that a focused team can do it smarter, faster and more efficiently than huge ad conglomerates.
              <p>Then, in 1999, Scott co-founded StrawberryFrog with Karin Drakenberg, Brian Elliott and with Uli Wisendsanger-the 'W' of TBWA-as Chairman. Their mission was to build a very rare kind of agency staffed with a very unique group of people, all focused on delivering "Total Engagement". An approach the team coined to describe the merger of advertising, content, entertainment and actions. And to this day, the agency has thrived developing work for some of the worlds most respected brands including Heineken, Diet Coke, Old Navy, Google, TBS, Asics Tiger, Sara Lee, Ikea, MTV, Mega Bloks and Mitsubishi Motors in  Europe.</div>
              <p>Fortune Magazine recently named StrawberryFrog as one of the hottest new ad agencies in the United States. Fast Company named StrawberryFrog as on of the agencies to watch in the new year.
